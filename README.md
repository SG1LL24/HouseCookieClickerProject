# HouseCookieClickerProject
 This repository features a Cookie Clicker app created through Java code with Android Studio. The app is themed after the show "House M.D.", and features a clickable House head resembling the "cookie". By clicking the head, you will receive vicodin pills and can receive one of three upgrades: a cane, a motorcycle, or a CT Scan.
